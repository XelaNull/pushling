`BehaviorStack` (`Pushling/Sources/Pushling/Behavior/BehaviorStack.swift`)
is the single source of truth for creature visual state, called once per
frame from `PushlingScene.update()` and required to complete in under 1ms.
It is the mechanical implementation of the philosophy in
[the vision concept](/vision.md#the-dual-layer-embodiment-model): Layer 1
(Physics + Reflexes + Autonomous) is the nervous system that never stops;
Layer 3 (AI-Directed) is Claude's mind, active only while inhabiting the
creature. This concept covers the priority resolution and blend timing
built and shipped; the command-queue semantics that were *designed* for
Layer 3 but never built are documented separately in
[the AI command queue](/SYSTEMS/ai-command-queue.md) to avoid minting
unverified prescriptive contract here.

# The Four Layers

Each layer implements `BehaviorLayer.update(deltaTime:currentTime:) ->
LayerOutput` independently, every frame, regardless of whether higher
layers will end up overriding it — a lower layer's computation never stops
just because a higher layer currently wins.

| Priority | Layer | Source | Duration | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | **Physics** | Daemon core (`PhysicsLayer`) | Always | Breathing sine-wave, gravity, boundary enforcement |
| 2 | **Reflexes** | Input events (`ReflexLayer`) | 0.5–3.0s per reflex | Ear perk on commit, flinch on force push |
| 3 | **AI-Directed** | Claude's MCP commands (`AIDirectedLayer`) | Until complete or 30s timeout | Walk to center, speak, express joy |
| 4 (lowest) | **Autonomous** | Daemon's own state machine (`AutonomousLayer`) | Continuous default | Wander, blink, groom, explore, loaf |

**Resolution rule, per-property:** for every property in `LayerOutput`
(position, facing, walk speed, and each body-part semantic state),
`BehaviorStack.resolveOutputs()` picks the **highest-priority layer whose
value for that property is non-nil**, falling through
`physics ?? reflexes ?? ai ?? autonomous ?? stageDefault`. A `nil` means "I
have no opinion — defer to the layer below me," so two layers can each own
different properties simultaneously (e.g. the Reflex layer overrides only
ear state while the AI-Directed layer still owns walk speed and position).
This per-property merge — not a single "which layer is active" switch — is
the actual mechanism behind the vision doc's "human touch always wins"
claim: a touch-triggered reflex overriding `earLeftState`/`earRightState`
takes effect immediately regardless of what Layer 3 (AI-Directed) is doing
with position or speech that same frame, with no special-cased touch/AI
arbitration code required.

## Layer 1: Physics

Always running, never suppressed even during a cinematic freeze — breathing
continues literally always. Computes gravity, boundary detection
(`nearBoundary()`, which the stack uses to tell the Autonomous layer to
turn around), and jump arcs. Owns the `breathingScale` output, which
bypasses the blend controller entirely and applies directly to the
creature's Y-scale every frame — the one animation that is never
interpolated because it must never visibly pause.

## Layer 2: Reflexes

`ReflexLayer` holds up to 5 simultaneous `ActiveReflex` instances (oldest
evicted past that), each an instance of a pre-defined `ReflexDefinition`
(name, duration 0.5–3.0s, a `fadeoutFraction` — typically 0.2 — of that
duration spent blending its override back toward nil, and the `LayerOutput`
properties it overrides). `ear_perk` (0.8s duration) and `flinch` are two
named reflexes defined in code; reflexes are triggered via
`BehaviorStack.triggerReflex(named:at:)`, called by `CreatureTouchHandler`
(e.g. `"ear_perk"` and `"look_at_touch"` on touch events) and by commit
processing. There is no separate "500ms lease" constant in code — each
reflex's own `duration` field governs how long it holds priority, and its
own `blendFactor` (1.0 during the active portion, ramping to 0.0 during the
trailing fadeout fraction) governs the smoothness of its release, not a
single universal lease timer.

## Layer 3: AI-Directed

`AIDirectedLayer` runs a state machine with four states: `inactive`,
`executing`, `standby(idleTime:)`, `fadingOut(elapsed:)`. Commands
(`AICommand`: id, `AICommandType` — walk/speak/express/perform/look/idle —
a `LayerOutput`, a `holdDuration`, an enqueue timestamp) are appended to a
plain FIFO array via `BehaviorStack.enqueueAICommand()`; see
[the AI command queue concept](/SYSTEMS/ai-command-queue.md) for exactly
what this array does and does not do relative to the originally-designed
spec.

**Verified constants** (`AIDirectedLayer.swift`):

| Constant | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `timeoutDuration` | 30.0s | Seconds of no new command before fadeout begins |
| `fadeoutDuration` | 5.0s | Duration of the gradual release back to Autonomous |
| `warmStandbyMild` | 10.0s | After this much idle time, walk speed begins reducing toward 0 (floor 0.3× at the moderate threshold) |
| `warmStandbyModerate` | 20.0s | After this, walk-speed override clears entirely, ceding speed to Autonomous |

During `fadingOut`, properties release in a staggered order rather than all
at once, matching the vision doc's "gradual softening" framing exactly:
walk speed holds through 60% of the 5.0s fadeout (3s), all body-part
expression states hold through 40% (2s), and position/facing hold longest,
through 80% (4s) — so a walking, expressive AI-directed action visibly
slows first, stops "meaning" anything expressively next, and only loses its
spot in space last.

## Layer 4: Autonomous

`AutonomousLayer` runs a state machine (`walking`, `idle`,
`behavior(name:)`, `taughtBehavior(name:)`, `objectInteracting(objectID:)`,
`resting`, `dreaming`) driven by `BehaviorSelector`'s weighted random
selection, gated by the current `GrowthStage` (via `stage.baseWalkSpeed`/
`baseRunSpeed`, defined per-stage in `GrowthStage` — see
[growth stages](/REFERENCE/growth-stages.md)) and modulated by the current
`PersonalitySnapshot`/`EmotionalSnapshot` and any active
[emergent state](/REFERENCE/personality-emotional-state.md#emergent-states).
Always computing, even while a higher layer is fully in control — this is
what lets the "AI releases control" fadeout hand off smoothly instead of
needing to spin the Autonomous layer up cold.

## The 12 Cat Behaviors

`CatBehaviors.swift` + `CatBehaviorsExtended.swift` register **12 cat-specific
choreographies**, `.behavior(name:)` states the Autonomous layer's
`BehaviorSelector` can pick weighted-randomly, each an independent state
machine composing `CreatureNode`'s body-part controllers. All 12 exist and
are wired (`GameCoordinator` holds the registry) — code-verified against the
vision doc's 12-item catalog, but **not name-for-name**: 10 of the 12
match the vision list exactly (slow-blink, kneading, headbutt, predator
crouch, loaf, grooming, zoomies, chattering, if-I-fits-I-sits, knocking
things off); the vision doc's remaining two entries are **"tail twitch"**
and **"ear perk"** (`PUSHLING_VISION.md:162-163`), neither of which exists
as an autonomous-behavior name — the code's 11th and 12th slots are
`tail_chase` and `tongue_blep` instead, two different behaviors entirely.
The substance of tail-twitch/ear-perk survives elsewhere in the codebase
as reflexes and reactive body-language rather than autonomous behaviors
(see [Layer 2: Reflexes](#layer-2-reflexes) above and [emotional visual
feedback](/REFERENCE/personality-emotional-state.md#emotional-visual-feedback-axis--body-language)),
just not as members of this 12-item registry:

| # | Name (code) | Min stage | Duration | Cooldown | Weight | Priority | Trigger semantic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `slow_blink` | Drop | 1.0–1.2s | 120s | 0.8 | 3 | Affection/trust — eyes close halfway, hold, open |
| 2 | `kneading` | Critter | 4–8s | 300s | 0.5 | 2 | Pre-sleep ritual — front paws alternate, eyes half-close |
| 3 | `headbutt` | Critter | 1.2–1.8s | 180s | 0.6 | 3 | Affection display — walks to edge, bonks, recoils |
| 4 | `predator_crouch` | Critter | 1.5–2.5s | 60s | 0.7 | 5 | Hunting incoming commits — low stance, butt-wiggle ×3, ears flat |
| 5 | `loaf` | Critter | 30–60s | 600s | 0.3 | 1 | Maximum comfort — all paws tucked, perfect rectangle |
| 6 | `grooming` | Critter | 3–5s | 240s | 0.5 | 2 | Post-meal idle — paw-lick, head tilt |
| 7 | `zoomies` | Critter | 2–4s | 600s | 0.2 | **6 (highest)** | Sudden speed burst — no warning, no reason |
| 8 | `chattering` | Critter | 1.5–2.5s | 180s | 0.4 | 4 | Jaw vibrates at flying birds/particles — prey drive |
| 9 | `if_i_fits_i_sits` | Critter | 10–20s | 600s | 0.2 | 2 | Squeezes into the smallest terrain gap available |
| 10 | `knocking_things_off` | **Beast** | 2.5–3.5s | 420s | 0.3 | 3 | Deliberately pushes a terrain object off, watches, looks at camera |
| 11 | `tail_chase` | Critter | 4–6s | 480s | 0.2 | 3 | Notices own tail, chases in circles, catches it, pretends nothing happened |
| 12 | `tongue_blep` | Drop | 15–30s | 600s | 0.15 | 1 (lowest) | Tongue sticks out 1px, stays out, creature doesn't notice (also [Surprise #42](/REFERENCE/surprise-catalog.md)) |

`zoomies` carries the highest priority (6) of any autonomous behavior —
matching its vision-doc framing as an override-everything cat moment;
`tongue_blep` the lowest, letting anything else preempt it. `loaf` and
`if_i_fits_i_sits` are the two longest-running (up to 60s and 20s
respectively) and both carry a 600s cooldown to match, so the creature isn't
stuck loafing or wedged for a large fraction of an active session.
`knocking_things_off` is the only one of the 12 gated to Beast+ rather than
Critter+ or Drop+ — code-verified, not vision-doc-specified.

## Absence-Scaled Wake Behaviors

`AbsenceAnimations.swift` implements the vision doc's "longer absence, more
excited reunion" wake rule as **6 graduated categories** (finer-grained than
the vision doc's 3-tier framing), each a keyframed `AnimationKeyframe`
sequence consumed by the Autonomous layer on wake:

| Category | Absence | Animation duration | Choreography |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brief` | < 1hr | 1.0s | Quick stretch, stand |
| `shortBreak` | 1–8hr | 3.0s | Ears droop → yawn → stretch → stand → kneading (Critter+) |
| `overnight` | 8–24hr | 4.0s | Sleep-curl → stir → big yawn → dramatic stretch (paws extend) → shake head, look around |
| `fewDays` | 1–3d | 5.0s | Overnight sequence + cautious crouch-sniff (ears perk, eyes wide, whiskers forward) → stand and look around |
| `longAbsence` | 3–7d | 6.0s | Sleep-curl with **cobweb** metadata → stir/shake-cobwebs → eyes wide (recognizes developer) → tail poofs → **run across the bar** (walk speed 50) → slow down |
| `extended` | 7+d | 8.0s | Deep sleep, **heavy cobwebs** → slow stir → vigorous shake (cobwebs fly off) → extreme happiness (wide eyes, poofed tail, smile) → **zoomies** (walk speed 70) → turn and zoom back → slow down, overjoyed (happy eyes, wagging tail, smile) → calm |

This directly and verifiably implements the vision doc's "No guilt — longer
absence = more excited reunion" rule: animation duration, walk speed, and
emotional intensity (droop → stretch → wide-eyed → poofed-tail → full
zoomies) all scale monotonically with absence length, with cobweb-shedding
appearing only at 3+ days and heavy cobwebs only at 7+.

**Late-night lantern** (`LateNightLantern`, same file): after **10PM**
(`activationHour = 22`), if the developer is still active, the creature
produces a tiny Gilt lantern that bobs gently at its side; it persists until
**5AM** (`dismissHour`) or a **30-minute cooldown** after manual dismissal.
If the developer goes idle for **10 minutes** (`sleepIdleSeconds`) while the
lantern is out, the lantern dims to a "sleeping with lantern" state (alpha
0.4, dimmer glow) rather than being dismissed — "solidarity, not judgment,"
per the vision doc, implemented as the creature keeping the lantern lit
through its own idle/sleep rather than putting it away.

**Not built**: the vision doc's Working-row ambient behaviors — ears
tracking toward the keyboard and idle daydreams referencing recent commit
messages — have no corresponding code (`isTyping`/keystroke-tracking greps
return nothing); preserved as unbuilt intent in
[the feature roadmap](/FEATURES/roadmap.md#tier-3-developer-workflow-integration)
rather than asserted as live here.

**Session-event reactions** (first MCP command, session connect/disconnect,
reconnect-after-absence) are wired through `SessionManager`/
`SessionLifecycleReactions`, not this stack's own layer-priority machinery
— that content, including the P4-T4-06 design table and what actually
shipped of it, lives in
[MCP session lifecycle's Session Event Reactions](/ARCHITECTURE/mcp-session-lifecycle.md#session-event-reactions),
cross-linked from here rather than duplicated.

# The Blend Controller

`BlendController` never lets the resolved per-frame state snap
instantaneously; it interpolates per-property, tracking independent
`PropertyBlend`s so different body parts can be mid-transition
simultaneously. Verified transition durations
(`Pushling/Sources/Pushling/Behavior/LayerTypes.swift` `BlendTransitionType`,
cross-checked against `BlendController.swift`):

| Transition | Duration | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction reversal** | 0.433s total | 4-phase state machine: decelerate to 0 (0.15s, ease-out) → pause 2 frames (~0.033s) → flip facing → accelerate to target speed (0.25s, ease-in) |
| **Expression change** | 0.8s base | Per-body-part crossfade with independent sub-timing: ears lead at 0.2s, eyes 0.15s, mouth/body 0.3s, tail/aura 0.5s, whiskers 0.1s — all scaled by `PersonalityFilter.animationTempo()` (energetic creatures transition faster) |
| **Reflex interrupt** | 0.15s total | Cascading snap, NOT tempo-scaled (must stay consistently fast regardless of personality): ears at 0s, eyes/whiskers at 0.05s, body/tail/mouth/aura at 0.10s, each a further 0.05s ramp |
| **AI takes control** | 0.3s | Ease-in |
| **AI releases control** | 5.0s | Ease-out, matching `AIDirectedLayer`'s `fadeoutDuration` above |

Position is blended separately from body-part states: while walking,
position advances by `currentWalkSpeed × facing`; a large discrepancy
between the blended position and a directly-requested position (e.g. an AI
`walk`-to-target command) is closed by lerp at a rate that's faster during
an active AI-takeover transition (0.3s time-constant) than otherwise
(0.1s). A reflex interrupt can preempt an in-flight lower-priority
transition, but a lower-priority transition cannot preempt an in-flight
reflex interrupt before its own 0.15s completes — the one explicit
priority rule inside the blend controller itself, separate from the layer
resolution priority above.

# External API Surface

Callers outside the stack (`CommandRouter`/`ActionHandlers` for MCP
commands, `CreatureTouchHandler` for touch, `GameCoordinator` for habits and
mutation-badge reactions) interact through:
`triggerReflex(_:at:)` / `triggerReflex(named:at:)`, `enqueueAICommand(_:)`,
`cancelAICommands()`, `aiSessionEnded()`, `setSleeping(_:)`,
`startJump(initialVelocity:)`, `updateStage(_:)`,
`freezeForCinematic()`/`thawFromCinematic()` (used for scripted sequences —
suppresses Autonomous transitions and clears Reflexes, but Physics/breathing
always continues even here), and `reset(stage:position:facing:)`.
